# AirPollutionPrediction
Using ANN on multiple target labels to predict quantities of Air Pollutants

Project includes:
  - EDA of given data
  - Feature Engineering to transform data 
  - Feature Selection
  - Regression using ANN (Keras, Tensorflow)
  - Hyperparameter Tuning of models
  - 
Do not run all cells of the notebook in one go. Hyperparameter tuning takes time to run depending on your system config. 8gb RAM recommended.
